- Primarly coded on a Windows 10 machine but should be globally compatible
- Coded with Python 3.9.13

### RUN INSTRUCTIONS ###
- Make sure pip is installed on your machine
- Create a new virtual env (Optional) and run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  to install all packages for this program
- Run main.py to run the best classification method on the test data and
  generate an output. You can also follow the instructions in main.py to 
  recompute the best classifier and hyperparameters, but this takes a significant
  time to run on most machines as it tests many scenarios.
- Enjoy!
